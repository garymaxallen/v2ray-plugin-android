# v2ray-plugin-android

fail to detect internet connection: unable to resolve host cp.cloudflare.com no address associated with hostname

If you met this error with v2ray-plugin-android, I wish this will help you.

My environment is.

Smartphone: Mi8 Lite

Shadowsocks Android version: 5.2.5 (at this moment, the lastest version)

Initially, I installed v2ray-plugin-android 1.3.3 (at this moment, the lastest version), I met the "cp.cloudflare.com" error. I was shocked, what the hell is cp.cloudflare.com.

I googled, there are a lot of misleading theories including dns settings or the IPS provider blocking the ip and so on.

After some reflection and thought and analysis, I installed the 1.3.1 version, and it worked. God.

In the end, the seemingly unsolvable problems are always about software versions, or BUGS.
